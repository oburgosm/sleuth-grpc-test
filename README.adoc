= Demo for gRPC instrumentation with sleuth

This projects has two modules, `grpc-client` and `grpc-server`

For bothb of them, to see traces on zipkin you should start a zipkin server on port 9411

For example with docker:

----
docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin
----

== Modules 

=== grpc-client

A webflux application that publish a reactive endpoint an call grp-server using a reactive grpc client stub

You can run it with:

----
mvn spring-boot:run
----

=== grpc-server

You can run it with:

----
mvn spring-boot:run
----

== Testing application

`http://localhost:8080/hello/<yourName>`. Then search traces at `http://localhost:9411/zipkin/`

You can change _spring-cloud-dependencies_ version setting property `spring-cloud-dependencies.version` at 
root project pom.xml.Trace is good  for _Hoxton.SR2_, but not foe next versions. The difference only occurs if we have
a subscribeOn on `MyController#hello`
